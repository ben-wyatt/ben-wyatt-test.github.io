## Headings

# H1 Heading
## H2 Heading
### H3 Heading
#### H4 Heading
##### H5 Heading
###### H6 Heading

## Paragraphs & Line Breaks

This is a paragraph of text. It should wrap naturally based on CSS.

This is another paragraph separated by a blank line.

Line breaks can be added with two spaces at the end of a line.  
This line should appear directly below the previous one.

## Emphasis

Regular text, with variations:

- Italic with asterisks: *italic*
- Italic with underscores: _italic_
- Bold with double asterisks: **bold**
- Bold with double underscores: __bold__
- Bold and italic: ***bold italic***
- Strikethrough (GFM): ~~strikethrough~~
- Inline code: `const answer = 42;`

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It can span multiple lines to form a single block.
>
> Add blank quote lines to separate paragraphs within a quote.

Nested blockquotes:

> Parent quote
>> Child quote
>>> Grandchild quote

## Lists

Unordered list:

- Item A
- Item B
  - Nested item B.1
  - Nested item B.2
- Item C

Ordered list (numbers can be arbitrary, but render sequentially):

1. First
1. Second
1. Third
   1. Third-A
   1. Third-B

Task list (GFM):

- [ ] To do item
- [x] Completed item
- [ ] Another item

## Code

Inline code has been shown above. Fenced code blocks with language hints below.

```javascript
// JavaScript example
function greet(name) {
  const message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
  return message;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

```python
# Python example
from datetime import date

def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}! Today is {date.today()}"

print(greet("World"))
```

```bash
# Bash example
echo "Hello" | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'
```

```json
{
  "name": "example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true
}
```

```diff
diff --git a/file.txt b/file.txt
index 83db48f..f735c20 100644
--- a/file.txt
+++ b/file.txt
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
-old line
+new line
 unchanged line
```

## Tables

Simple table:

| Animal | Sound  |
| ------ | ------ |
| Cat    | Meow   |
| Dog    | Bark   |

Alignment (GFM):

| Left | Center | Right |
| :--- | :----: | ----: |
| a    |   b    |     c |
| long text here | centered | 12345 |

### Large Table

Four columns and three rows with multi-sentence content in each cell.

| Overview | Details | Considerations | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| This section introduces the main idea of the row. It provides quick context and sets expectations. Clarity and brevity are prioritized here. | This cell expands on the topic with supporting information. It adds examples and gives the reader concrete anchors. The tone remains neutral and descriptive. | Here we discuss trade-offs and caveats. Edge cases and constraints are highlighted to guide decisions. Readers should weigh costs against benefits. | The concluding cell summarizes what happens next. It names the decision and calls out follow-ups. Success criteria are briefly reiterated.
| The second row focuses on a variation of the theme. It contrasts with the first to show boundaries. Similarities are noted to reduce cognitive load. | Additional depth is provided with sequential steps. Assumptions are stated so the flow is reproducible. Alternatives are referenced for comparison. | Risks and mitigations are outlined succinctly. Failure modes are listed alongside detection methods. Owners and timelines are suggested. | The result proposes a clean path forward. It defines a checkpoint and a review cadence. Any blockers are documented transparently.
| This final row is intentionally verbose for wrapping tests. It ensures multi-sentence content behaves well across devices. Typography and spacing should remain readable. | Extra narrative stresses paragraph-like content inside cells. Punctuation and capitalization mirror normal writing. Links and inline code can appear too. | Performance and accessibility are considered. Keyboard navigation and screen reader cues should be preserved. Mobile columns may need stacking. | The outcome emphasizes maintainability and clarity. It summarizes learnings and closes the loop. Future adjustments are easy to apply.

### Two-Column Table

Two columns with multi-sentence cells to test wrapping and spacing.

| Column A | Column B |
| --- | --- |
| This left cell offers a short narrative. It provides context in two to three sentences so wrapping is visible. The tone stays neutral. | The right cell mirrors the style while varying the content. It validates consistent spacing and alignment. Formatting should remain balanced.
| Another example appears here to compare lengths across rows. Slightly longer phrasing helps exercise line breaks and hyphenation where available. | Complementary text balances the row and avoids dominance. It ensures readability across screen sizes and zoom levels for accessibility.
| Final row demonstrates stability under repeated patterns. Typography should remain readable and even, with adequate line-height and padding. | Closing text confirms that two-column layouts behave well. It focuses on clarity and rhythm of paragraphs for comfortable scanning.

## Footnotes

Here is a statement with a footnote.[^note]

Another footnote reference goes here.[^another]

[^note]: This is the first footnote text.
[^another]: And this is another footnote. Footnotes may or may not be rendered specially depending on the Markdown engine.

## Definition Lists

Term 1
: Definition A

Term 2
: Definition B, continued

Term with multiples
: First definition
: Second definition

> Note: Definition lists are not part of core Markdown; some engines support them, others render as paragraphs.

## Inline HTML

Use HTML for things Markdown doesnâ€™t natively support:

Text with <sup>superscript</sup> and <sub>subscript</sub>,
keyboard input like <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>,
and <mark>highlighted text</mark> using HTML tags.

## Details/Collapsible

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  <p>This content is hidden by default and revealed on click.</p>
  <pre><code>console.log('Details example');
</code></pre>
</details>

## Escaping

Escape special characters with backslashes: \*asterisks\*, \_underscores\_, \`backticks\`.

Show a literal backslash: \\

## Math (raw)

Inline math using delimiters (rendered as plain text unless a math plugin is enabled): \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).

Block math using delimiters:

\[
E = mc^2
\]
